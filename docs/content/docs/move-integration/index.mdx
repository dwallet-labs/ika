# Move Contract Integration

Build Move smart contracts that integrate with Ika's distributed wallet (dWallet) protocol to enable programmable, decentralized signing for cross-chain operations.

## What is Move Integration?

Move integration allows you to embed dWallet functionality directly into your Sui Move smart contracts. This enables:

- **Programmable Signing**: Define custom logic that controls when and how signatures are created
- **Cross-Chain Operations**: Sign transactions for Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other chains from Sui contracts
- **Decentralized Custody**: Build DAOs, treasuries, and governance systems with distributed key management
- **Automated Workflows**: Create smart contracts that can sign without user interaction (using shared dWallets)

## Architecture Overview

## When to Use Move Integration

### Use Move Integration When:

- Building **DAOs or treasuries** that need distributed signing authority
- Creating **governance systems** with approval workflows before signing
- Implementing **multi-signature wallets** with custom voting logic
- Building **automated trading bots** or DeFi protocols that sign on other chains
- Developing **custody solutions** with programmable access controls

### Use SDK-Only When:

- Building **user-facing wallets** where users hold their own keys
- Creating **simple signing flows** without on-chain logic
- Prototyping before committing to on-chain architecture

## Key Concepts

| Concept                | Description                                                        |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **DWalletCoordinator** | The shared object that manages all dWallet operations on Ika       |
| **DWalletCap**         | Capability object that authorizes signing operations for a dWallet |
| **Presign**            | Pre-computed cryptographic material required before signing        |
| **MessageApproval**    | Authorization for signing a specific message                       |
| **SessionIdentifier**  | Unique identifier for each protocol operation                      |

## Protocol Lifecycle

## Quick Example

Here's a minimal example of a contract that creates a shared dWallet:

```rust
module my_protocol::treasury;

use ika::ika::IKA;
use ika_dwallet_2pc_mpc::{
    coordinator::DWalletCoordinator,
    coordinator_inner::{DWalletCap, UnverifiedPresignCap},
    sessions_manager::SessionIdentifier
};
use sui::{balance::Balance, coin::Coin, sui::SUI};

public struct Treasury has key, store {
    id: UID,
    dwallet_cap: DWalletCap,
    presigns: vector<UnverifiedPresignCap>,
    ika_balance: Balance<IKA>,
    sui_balance: Balance<SUI>,
}
```
