# Zero Trust Security and Decentralization

Since Bitcoin’s inception, Zero Trust and decentralization have been foundational principles of the Web3 ecosystem.
These principles ensure that no single entity or group of entities can steal user assets or manipulate the network,
promoting a secure, transparent, and equitable digital infrastructure.

## Zero Trust Security

Zero Trust refers to the design and operation of systems in a way that requires continuous verification and approval for
any action.
In the context of blockchain and Web3 technologies, this means ensuring that validators, miners, or any parties involved
in the network cannot steal user assets, even if they are compromised.

In the context of a specific blockchain, Zero Trust is achieved through digital signatures.
Even if all nodes on a specific network colluded, they can never sign a transaction on behalf of the user who holds the
private key.
That is a fundamental value that Web3 is built upon.

## Decentralization

Decentralization disperses power away from a central authority, distributing control among many independent nodes or
participants.
This ensures that no single party has complete control over the network, enhancing security, resilience, and resistance
to censorship.

Whatever the consensus mechanism is, decentralization helps protect users in blockchains from double spending and
similar attacks.

## dWallets—Non-collusive and Massively Decentralized

Zero Trust and decentralization are not just technical features; they are the bedrock principles that underpin the
trust, security, and openness of the Web3 ecosystem.
dWallets are the enablers of [secure multi-chain interoperability](multi-chain-vs-cross-chain.md) due to their
non-collusive and massively decentralized nature.

Developers integrating these principles into their projects using dWallets contribute to a more robust, secure, and
democratic digital future, in line with the original vision of blockchain technology.
By prioritizing these values, Web3 projects can ensure they are building systems that are truly for the benefit of all
users, maintaining the integrity and resilience of decentralized networks.
