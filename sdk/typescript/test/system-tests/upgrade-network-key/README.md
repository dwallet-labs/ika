# Upgrade Network Key System Test

To run the test in this folder:

1. Build the `ika` and `ika-swarm-config` binaries from revision `d9ff6d612913ce526b424175838945495bf2db1d` of this
   repository.  
   _This revision matches the one used for the mainnet Docker image._

2. Copy the built binaries to an `old_mainnet_binaries` directory in this folder, naming them `mainnet-release-ika` and
   `mainnet-release-ika-swarm-config`.
